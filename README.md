Development
-----------

<details>

<summary>Requirements</summary>

- [Docker]
- [GNU Make]
- [Node.js v14.6.0]
- [NPM v6.14.6]

</details>

The project contains a [Makefile] which uses [Docker] for development.

### Running the app

To build and run the app for development, execute:

```shell
make dev
```

You can now access the app at <http://localhost:8000>.
Also you can access Minio cloud storage server compatible with Amazon S3 at <http://localhost:9000>.

<details>

<summary>Rebuilding the container</summary>

Static content is attached to the containers as volumes so most updates are visible without a need to rebuild the
container. However, changes to NPM dependencies, for example, require a rebuild. So you may need to execute

```shell
make dev
```

again before running further commands.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Configuring environment variables</summary>

You can create a `.env` file to pass environment variables to the container:

```
DISQUS_API_KEY=...
```

Re-run `make dev` after modifying this file.

</details>

### Running the tests

We use [Jest] to test the app. You can run it by executing: 

```shell
make test
```

### Linting

We lint the app with [ESLint]. You can run it by:

```shell
make lint
```

You can fix problems, where possible, by executing:

```shell
make lint:fix
```

## Operations

The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster via a Helm chart.

A [production environment] is [updated][production deployments] manually by pushing a tag.

### Releasing to production

Ensure your current reference is [green in CI][build].

Run `make release`.

### Looking at logs

Logs of all Pods are streamed to [AWS CloudWatch][AWS CloudWatch logs] for persistence and searchability.

A [CloudWatch dashboard] graphs log lines representing errors and shows the state of the alarm.

A [monitoring SNS topic] triggers a [lambda function that notifies the Slack #article-hosting-commits channel][monitoring lambda].

### Configure images on local machine

You must access Minio cloud storage server at <http://localhost:9000>, create a bucket with the name ```images``` and upload images.
After accessing images via Cantaloupe, a cache folder will be created for corresponding images.
